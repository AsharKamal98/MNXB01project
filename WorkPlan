Division of workload:

Zack:


Jesper:
Create "tempOnDay.C" that takes month and day as argument and return a histogram containing the temperatures of that day throughout the years.
Create "comp.C" that compares the temperature of a given month between two datasets.
Bash script "data_cleaner.sh" which cleans data so its easier to read for "tempOnDay.C" and "comp.C"

Ashar:
Declare/initialize constructor which in "tempTrender.h/tempTrender.cpp" which intitializes an array (as a member variable) containing average daily temperature over some period of years. Construct a member function in the class, it should plot the histogram with error bars. The class is called in project.cpp. Above mention filtering done in bash script "data_cleaner2.sh". Worked as release manager.
